# Mini TypeScript Hero - Project Guide

## 📖 What Is This Project?

**Mini TypeScript Hero** is a VSCode extension that sorts and organizes TypeScript/JavaScript imports. It's a modernized extraction of the single most valuable feature from the deprecated TypeScript Hero extension.

**Original Author**: Christoph Bühler (no longer maintains TypeScript Hero)
**New Maintainer**: Angular.Schule (Johannes Hoppe)
**License**: MIT (with attribution to original author)
**Repository**: https://github.com/angular-schule/mini-typescript-hero

**Terminology**:
- **Old extension** = Original "TypeScript Hero" by Christoph Bühler (deprecated, uses typescript-parser)
  - Included as git submodule at `tests/comparison/old-typescript-hero/`
  - Used by comparison tests to verify backward compatibility
- **New extension** = This project "Mini TypeScript Hero" (modern, uses ts-morph)

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Extract and modernize the "Sort and organize your imports" feature with:
- ✅ **Comprehensive backward compatibility** with TypeScript Hero settings
- ✅ **Modern tech stack** (ts-morph, esbuild, latest TypeScript)
- ✅ **No dependencies on deprecated libraries** (typescript-parser is 7 years old!)
- ✅ **Simplified architecture** (no InversifyJS DI container overkill)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Old TypeScript Hero (Complex)
```
extension.ts
  └─> TypescriptHero (DI container orchestrator)
      └─> ImportOrganizer (Activatable)
          └─> ImportManagerProvider
              └─> ImportManager
                  ├─> TypescriptParser (deprecated)
                  ├─> TypescriptCodeGenerator
                  ├─> Configuration
                  ├─> Logger (winston)
                  └─> Import Groups
```

### Mini TypeScript Hero (Simplified)
```
extension.ts
  └─> ImportOrganizer
      ├─> Configuration (simple wrapper)
      ├─> Logger (OutputChannel)
      └─> ImportManager
          ├─> ts-morph (modern parser)
          └─> Import Groups
```

**Key Simplifications**:
- ❌ No InversifyJS (direct instantiation)
- ❌ No winston (native VSCode OutputChannel)
- ❌ No typescript-parser (modern ts-morph)
- ✅ 80% less code complexity

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy - CRITICAL!

### 🚨 THE GOLDEN RULE: USE REAL VSCODE APIS, NOT MOCKS!

**We learned this the hard way** over multiple sessions:

**What We Did Wrong**:
- Created MockTextDocument with fake URIs
- Wrote homegrown `applyEdits()` function with line-based text manipulation
- Spent HOURS debugging "bugs" that were actually bugs in OUR mock code
- These were **phantom bugs** - illusions created by wrong assumptions in mocks

**The Reality**:
- VSCode uses offset-based editing (piece tree data structure)
- Our line-based mocks were fundamentally wrong and created fake bugs
- Tests run IN REAL VSCODE - we have access to ALL real APIs!
- **Mock code assumptions were COMPLETELY WRONG**

**The Correct Approach**:
- ✅ Use `workspace.openTextDocument()` with REAL temp files in `os.tmpdir()`
- ✅ Use `workspace.applyEdit()` - VSCode's battle-tested implementation
- ✅ Clean up temp files in finally blocks
- ❌ NEVER write homegrown text edit logic
- ❌ NEVER use mocked TextDocument with fake URIs

---

### 🚨 MANDATORY TEST ASSERTION PATTERN - NO EXCEPTIONS!

**CRITICAL**: Every test MUST validate against explicit expected output. Comparing two results without validating correctness is WORTHLESS.

#### ❌ NEVER USE THIS PATTERN:

```typescript
// BAD - Both could return empty string and test passes!
// BAD - Both could have the SAME BUG and test passes!
const oldResult = await organizeImportsOld(input);
const newResult = await organizeImportsNew(input);
assert.equal(newResult, oldResult);  // ❌ WORTHLESS - doesn't validate correctness!
```

**Why This Is Worthless**:
- If both extensions return empty string → test passes (FALSE POSITIVE)
- If both extensions have the same bug → test passes (FALSE POSITIVE)
- Doesn't validate that the output is actually CORRECT
- Only validates that two potentially broken things match each other

#### ✅ ALWAYS USE THIS PATTERN:

**For Unit Tests (main extension):**
```typescript
// CORRECT - Validates against known-good expected output
const input = `...source code...`;

const expected = `...VERIFIED correct output...`;  // ✅ Get from REAL extension or manual verification

const result = await organizeImports(input, config);

assert.equal(result, expected, 'Must produce correct output');  // ✅ Validates correctness!
```

**For Comparison Tests:**
```typescript
// CORRECT - Validates BOTH extensions against known-good expected output
const input = `...source code...`;

const expected = `...VERIFIED from REAL old extension...`;  // ✅ Get from REAL old extension, NEVER guess!

const oldResult = await organizeImportsOld(input, config);
const newResult = await organizeImportsNew(input, config);

assert.equal(oldResult, expected, 'Old extension must produce correct output');  // ✅ Validates old is correct
assert.equal(newResult, expected, 'New extension must produce correct output');  // ✅ Validates new is correct
```

#### 📋 Mandatory Requirements:

1. **EVERY test** must have explicit `expected` output
2. **NEVER** compare two results without validating against expected
3. **Get expected from REAL extension behavior** - NEVER guess or assume
4. **Run old extension** to capture actual output, don't make assumptions
5. **Clear assertion messages** explaining what's being validated

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - tests must validate correctness, not just equality!

## 🧪 Test Infrastructure - CRITICAL!

### Why Tests Need a Pre-Configured Workspace

**The Problem:** Tests that call `workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders()` cause VS Code to restart the extension host. In CI headless mode, this crashes tests with `{ name: 'Canceled' }` errors.

**The Solution:** Pre-configure a workspace folder that VS Code opens BEFORE tests run. Tests create temp files INSIDE this workspace instead of mutating the workspace structure.

### Configuration Files Explained

**.vscode-test.mjs** configures the test runner with TWO different directories:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
    files: 'out/tests/unit/**/*.test.js',
    workspaceFolder: path.join(__dirname, 'tests/workspaces/single-root'),  // ← WORKSPACE
    launchArgs: ['--user-data-dir=/tmp/mths-user-data'],                    // ← USER DATA
    mocha: { timeout: 10000 }
});
```

| Setting | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `workspaceFolder` | `tests/workspaces/single-root/` | **Workspace** - the "project folder" VS Code opens. Tests create temp files here. |
| `--user-data-dir` | `/tmp/mths-user-data` | **User data** - VS Code's internal storage (settings, extensions, caches). Isolated from your real VS Code installation. |

**Visual representation:**
```
VS Code Test Instance
├── Workspace: tests/workspaces/single-root/   ← Project folder (workspaceFolder)
│   └── mths-workspace-123456-abc/             ← Temp files created by tests
│       ├── file1.ts
│       └── file2.ts
│
└── User Data: /tmp/mths-user-data             ← VS Code internals (--user-data-dir)
    ├── User/settings.json
    ├── extensions/
    └── logs/
```

**Why `/tmp/mths-user-data`?**
- macOS has a 103-character limit for Unix socket paths
- Default VS Code user-data paths can exceed this limit, causing crashes
- Short path `/tmp/mths-user-data` avoids this issue

**Why `tests/workspaces/single-root/`?**
- Tests need a workspace to be open for `vscode.workspace.*` APIs
- Pre-opening avoids `workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders()` calls that crash CI
- Temp files are created INSIDE this folder and cleaned up after tests

### tsconfig.json Excludes

The `tests/workspaces` folder MUST be excluded from TypeScript compilation:

```json
{
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    ".vscode-test",
    "tests/manual",
    "tests/comparison",
    "tests/workspaces"           // ← IMPORTANT: Exclude temp test files!
  ]
}
```

**Why?** Tests create `.ts` files in `tests/workspaces/`. If a test crashes without cleanup, these orphaned files would cause TypeScript compilation errors.

---

## 🔧 Two Test Environments

### 1. General Extension Tests (`tests/unit/`)

**Purpose**: Ensure the new extension has high reliability and catches all known bugs

**What They Test**:
- All import organization features
- Configuration options
- Edge cases (shebangs, directives, old TypeScript syntax)
- Settings migration from old TypeScript Hero
- **Both** shared functionality (old+new) AND new-only features

**Test Nature**: These are **integration tests** that run in a real VS Code environment with the full TS/JS language server. They use real file I/O, real VS Code APIs, and real TypeScript parsing. This makes them slower but ensures they test the extension as users experience it.

**Test Pattern** (Now Using REAL VSCode APIs):
```typescript
// Create REAL temp file and open with VSCode
const doc = await createTempDocument(content);  // ✅ Real file in os.tmpdir()

try {
  const manager = new ImportManager(doc, config);
  const edits = manager.organizeImports();

  // Apply edits using VSCode's REAL API
  await applyEditsToDocument(doc, edits);  // ✅ workspace.applyEdit()

  const result = doc.getText();
  assert.equal(result, expected, 'Must produce correct output');  // ✅ Validates against expected
} finally {
  await deleteTempDocument(doc);  // ✅ Cleanup
}
```

All tests use REAL VSCode APIs with explicit expected outputs.

## 📦 Extension Activation

### Why We Keep `activationEvents` in package.json

The `activationEvents` array is **required and correct**:

```json
"activationEvents": [
  "onLanguage:typescript",
  "onLanguage:typescriptreact",
  "onLanguage:javascript",
  "onLanguage:javascriptreact"
],
```

**Common misconception:** VS Code 1.74+ made activation events "implicit"

**Reality:** Only **command** activation (`onCommand`) became implicit. Language-based activation (`onLanguage`) is different - it activates the extension when specific file types are opened.

**Why we need this:**
- Our extension must activate when TS/JS files are opened (not when commands are invoked)
- Without `onLanguage` activation events, the extension won't be ready when users open TypeScript/JavaScript files
- The `contributes.commands` entries only handle command registration, not language-based activation

**References:**
- VS Code 1.74 Release Notes: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_74
- StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/75303487 (about `onCommand`, NOT `onLanguage`)

---

### 2. Comparison Tests (`tests/comparison/`)

**Purpose**: Validate backward compatibility between old and new extension

**What They Test**:
- Direct comparison: old extension output vs new extension output
- Tests that new extension can replicate old behavior with correct settings
- ⚠️ **Note**: Both extensions process same input, configs may differ slightly (new extension has `legacyMode` flag)

**Test Pattern** (MANDATORY - Validates Both Against Expected):
```typescript
const input = `...source code...`;

// Expected output from REAL old extension (NEVER guessed!)
const expected = `...VERIFIED from old extension...`;

const oldResult = await organizeImportsOld(input, config);
const newResult = await organizeImportsNew(input, config);

// Both extensions must produce correct output
assert.equal(oldResult, expected, 'Old extension must produce correct output');
assert.equal(newResult, expected, 'New extension must produce correct output');
```

All tests use REAL VSCode APIs with verified expected outputs.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### 🌟 GOLDEN RULE: ts-morph Usually Supports Everything

**CRITICAL**: ts-morph is the leading TypeScript manipulation library. NEVER assume a feature is not available!

**Process**:
1. Check the API first with `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj))`
2. Search for methods related to your feature (e.g., `getAttributes()`, `getModifiers()`)
3. Test with real code to understand the API behavior
4. Only fall back to text manipulation if absolutely necessary

**Example**: Import attributes (`with { type: 'json' }`)
- ❌ Wrong assumption: "ts-morph doesn't support this, use regex"
- ✅ Correct approach: Check API → found `getAttributes()` → use proper API

**Why This Matters**:
- ts-morph handles edge cases (nested braces, comments, multi-line, etc.)
- Text manipulation is brittle and error-prone
- ts-morph APIs are well-tested and maintained

### Type-Only Imports Support (TS 3.8+)

**Location**: `src/imports/import-types.ts`, `src/imports/import-manager.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Extended model with `isTypeOnly` flag for `NamedImport` and `SymbolSpecifier`
- Parses both import-level (`import type`) and specifier-level (`type A`) modifiers using ts-morph
- Preserves type-only syntax in output generation
- All places where `NamedImport` instances are created preserve the flag

**Behavior**:
- **Modern mode** (`legacyMode: false`): Preserves `import type` syntax, keeps type/value imports separate (semantic requirement)
- **Legacy mode** (`legacyMode: true`): Strips `import type` keywords (matches old extension behavior)

### Import Merging Behavior

**How Both Extensions Merge**:
- **Old extension**: Merges imports from same module when `disableImportRemovalOnOrganize: false` (default)
- **New extension**: Has separate `mergeImportsFromSameModule` setting for explicit control

**Merge Timing Difference**:
- **Old extension**: Merges BEFORE `removeTrailingIndex`
  - `./lib/index` and `./lib` are treated as DIFFERENT modules (don't merge)
- **New extension (legacy mode)**: Merges BEFORE `removeTrailingIndex` (matches old behavior)
- **New extension (modern mode)**: Applies `removeTrailingIndex` FIRST, then merges
  - Both `./lib/index` and `./lib` become `./lib`, so they DO merge

---

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Use ts-morph Instead of typescript-parser
**Why**: typescript-parser is deprecated (7 years old, no updates). ts-morph is actively maintained, modern, and has better TypeScript support.

### 2. Decouple Merging from Removal
**Old Behavior**: `disableImportRemovalOnOrganize: false` did BOTH removal AND merging (coupled together)
**New Behavior**: Separate `mergeImportsFromSameModule` setting for explicit control
**Benefit**: Can merge imports without removing unused ones, or vice versa. More flexible than old coupled behavior.

### 3. Smart Settings Migration
**What**: Automatically migrates old TypeScript Hero settings to new extension
**How**: `src/configuration/settings-migration.ts` runs on activation
**Preserves**: Seamless migration - users don't notice the change, settings transfer automatically

### 4. Legacy Mode for Backward Compatibility
**Why**: Old extension has specific behaviors (blank lines, within-group sorting, merge timing bug) that users depend on
**How**: `legacyMode: true` replicates old formatting behaviors and merge timing quirks for output consistency (with documented exceptions for crashes and edge cases)
**For**: Migrated users get `legacyMode: true` automatically
**New Users**: Get `legacyMode: false` by default for modern best practices (1 blank line, correct sorting, proper merge timing)
**Note**: See README for specific behaviors replicated and exceptions. Both old and new extensions merge imports by default; legacy mode preserves the old merge-before-removeTrailingIndex timing that can create duplicates.

## 💡 Important Development Lessons

### Use Real VSCode APIs, Not Mocks
Tests run in REAL VSCode environment. Using mocked TextDocument and homegrown `applyEdits()` created phantom bugs that wasted debugging time. Always use `workspace.openTextDocument()` and `workspace.applyEdit()`.

### Test Assertion Pattern Must Be Mandatory
Comparing two results without validating against expected output is worthless - both could be wrong and test still passes. Every test must validate against explicit expected output from REAL extension behavior.

### Validate Assumptions Against Real Code
Testing artifacts can mislead. Code inspection revealed old extension DOES merge imports (via `libraryAlreadyImported` check), contrary to what test results initially suggested. Always verify behavioral assumptions by reading actual implementation.

### Type-Only Imports Are Semantic, Not Cosmetic
TypeScript 3.8+ `import type` syntax affects runtime semantics and bundling. Converting `import type { T }` to `import { T }` can break type-only import isolation, affect tree-shaking, and change module loading. New extension preserves `import type` in modern mode for correct TypeScript 3.8+ semantics.
